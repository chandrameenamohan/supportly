## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The database schema includes tables for:

- **brands**: Shoe brands like Nike, Adidas, etc.
- **categories**: Product categories with a hierarchical structure
- **products**: Main product table with flexible attributes
- **inventory**: Stock levels by product, size, and color
- **reviews**: Customer reviews and ratings
- **product_relations**: Relationships between products

The schema uses UUIDs, JSONB fields, proper indexing, and materialized views for optimal performance.

### Data Generation

Synthetic data is generated using a modular approach:

1. Each data type has its own generator module
2. The main `seed_data.py` script orchestrates the data generation
3. The generated data is saved to JSON files
4. The `json_to_sql.py` script converts the JSON data to SQL statements

### Database Access

Database access is implemented using a layered approach:

1. `db_connection.py`: Manages database connections using asyncpg and connection pooling
2. `products_repository.py`: Contains database queries for product-related operations
3. `products_agent.py`: Processes natural language queries about products

### Integration

The integration with the main application follows a tool-based approach:

1. `products_tool.py`: Defines the tool interface with supported actions
2. `integration.py`: Registers the products tool with the main application
3. The tool is used by the main application's agents to answer product-related queries

### Testing

The testing strategy includes comprehensive test coverage:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Sample Tests**: Clear examples of integration testing
4. **Test Runners**: Scripts to execute tests with detailed output

response = await client.post("/api/products/search", json={"query": "red Nike running shoes"})
```

### Getting Product Details

```python
# Using the products agent
agent = ProductsAgent()
result = await agent.get_product_details("product-id")

# Using the products tool
tool = ProductsTool()
result = await tool.execute("details", product_id="product-id")

# Via API endpoint
response = await client.post("/api/products/details", json={"product_id": "product-id"})
